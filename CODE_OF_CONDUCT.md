# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a safe, supportive, and healing experience for everyone, especially those who have experienced loss and trauma. This project was born from personal tragedy with the mission to prevent future harm to children and families worldwide.

## Our Standards

### Core Values

**Child Protection First**: Every action, decision, and contribution must prioritize the safety and wellbeing of children. No exceptions.

**Trauma-Informed Approach**: We recognize that many contributors may have experienced loss, grief, or trauma. All interactions should be conducted with sensitivity and compassion.

**From Grief to Hope**: We transform pain into purpose, loss into learning, and tragedy into positive systemic change.

### Expected Behavior

* **Compassionate Communication**: Use kind, patient, and understanding language
* **Child Safety Advocacy**: Actively support initiatives that protect children
* **Transparent Collaboration**: Share knowledge openly while respecting privacy
* **Inclusive Participation**: Welcome all who genuinely want to prevent harm
* **Constructive Problem-Solving**: Focus on solutions that serve the vulnerable
* **Respectful Disagreement**: Debate ideas while honoring the humanity of others

### Unacceptable Behavior

* Harassment, threats, or intimidation in any form
* Exploitation of vulnerable individuals or communities
