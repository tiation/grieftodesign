## 🔄 Current Status: Ready for Manual Submission

### Why Manual Submission?

The Wikipedia API approach failed due to **autoconfirm requirements**:
- Account needs to be 4+ days old
- Requires 10+ edits to existing articles
- Token has correct permissions but account lacks autoconfirm status

### 📝 Next Steps (Manual Process):

1. **Go to Wikipedia AfC**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_creation

2. **Create Draft Pages**:
   - `Draft:Grief-to-Design Blueprint`
   - `Draft:Pet Humans Blueprint`
   - `Draft:Cooperative Capitalism`
   - `Draft:Two Monkey Theory`
   - `Draft:19 Trillion Dollar Solution`

3. **Copy & Paste Content**:
   - Copy entire content from each `.txt` file
   - Paste into Wikipedia draft editor
   - Save with summary: "Submitting draft for AfC review"

4. **Monitor for Review**:
   - Wikipedia volunteers review within days/weeks
   - May request sources, changes, or clarifications
   - Approved articles move to main namespace

## 📊 Article Quality Features:

All drafts include:
- ✅ Proper Wikipedia infoboxes
- ✅ Structured sections and subsections
- ✅ Cross-references between related articles
- ✅ Appropriate categorization
- ✅ Reference sections (expandable)
- ✅ External links to source material
- ✅ Neutral encyclopedic tone

```

## 📈 Success Metrics:

- **5/5 articles** properly formatted
- **All concepts** systematically documented  
- **Cross-references** established between related topics
- **Foundation laid** for Wikipedia presence of grief-to-design framework

## ⚡ Alternative Approaches:

If manual submission is preferred to be automated:

1. **Build Account Reputation**:
   - Make minor edits to existing articles
   - Wait for autoconfirm status
   - Return to API approach

2. **Community Engagement**:
   - Engage with Wikipedia editors
   - Request feedback on draft quality
   - Build relationships before submission

3. **Iterative Improvement**:
   - Submit one article at a time
   - Learn from reviewer feedback
   - Apply lessons to subsequent submissions

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes:

### High Probability:
- Articles will require additional sources/references
- Reviewers may request clarification on notability
- Some concepts may be combined into broader articles

### Medium Probability:
- Direct approval if concepts gain academic/media attention
- Request to expand with more real-world implementations
- Suggestion to start with stubs and expand over time

### Preparation for Review:
All drafts are structured to address common AfC concerns:
- Clear articulation of concepts
- References to established fields
- Real-world examples where available
- Neutral point of view maintained
