The '''19 Trillion Dollar Solution''' is a comprehensive economic policy proposal for Australia that would redistribute the nation's existing $19 trillion in national wealth to eliminate debt, provide universal basic income, and transform governance structures. The proposal emerged from the [[Grief-to-Design Blueprint]] methodology as a systematic response to economic inequality and systemic failures.

== Overview ==

The solution proposes to mobilize Australia's existing national wealth of approximately $19 trillion to:
* Eliminate all public debt (federal, state, and local)
* Provide universal asset allocation ($416,000 per person)
* Fund five years of universal basic income ($800/week per person)
* Pre-pay essential services for five years
* Establish citizen-controlled governance structures

== Economic Foundation ==

=== National Wealth Composition ===
Australia's $19 trillion national wealth consists of:
* Residential property: ~$9.6 trillion
* Superannuation funds: ~$3.5 trillion
* Government assets: ~$2.8 trillion
* Business equity: ~$2.1 trillion
* Other assets: ~$1.0 trillion

=== Mathematical Framework ===
The proposal requires $11.36 trillion for universal allocation:
* 27.3 million Australians Ã— $416,000 each = $11.36 trillion
* Available through leveraging $8.33 trillion in identified assets
* Conservative 3:1 leverage ratio (standard for sovereign funds)
* Results in 10.7% safety margin with conservative assumptions

== Universal Asset Allocation ==

Each Australian resident would receive:

=== Housing Component ($208,000) ===
* $104,000 housing credit for purchase or rent subsidy
* $104,000 additional housing investment or cash equivalent
* Designed to eliminate housing insecurity

=== Business Component ($208,000) ===
* $104,000 business startup credit or investment portfolio
* $104,000 additional economic participation credit
* Enables entrepreneurship and economic participation

=== Income Security ===
* $800 per week for 5 years ($208,000 total)
* Generated through asset dividend yields
* Provides transition period for economic restructuring

== International Precedents ==

The proposal draws from successful examples:
* [[Alaska Permanent Fund]]: Annual dividends since 1982
* [[Norway Government Pension Fund Global|Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund]]: $1.4 trillion fund
* Various [[Universal basic income]] pilots worldwide
* [[Participatory budgeting]] implementations globally
