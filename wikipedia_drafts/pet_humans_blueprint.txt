The '''Pet Humans Blueprint''' is a social policy framework that proposes treating humans with the same care and consideration typically given to beloved pets. The blueprint argues that if humans were cared for with the same unconditional support, security, and attention to needs that people provide their pets, most social problems would be eliminated.

== Core Logic ==

The blueprint is based on a comparative analysis between how humans treat their pets versus how society treats humans:

=== What Pets Receive ===
* Food security without earning requirements
* Safe shelter as a given right
* Healthcare without hesitation about cost
* Play and enrichment opportunities
* Unconditional love regardless of productivity
* Protection from known dangers
* No forced labor expectations

=== What Humans Often Lack ===
* Employment requirements for survival ("work or starve")
* Complex bureaucracy for basic needs
* Debt-induced stress and insecurity
* Competition for basic necessities
* Conditional support based on productivity

== Implementation Framework ==

The blueprint proposes a five-phase implementation over five years:

=== Phase 1: Survival Needs (Months 1-6) ===
* Universal food allowance ($200/week per person)
* Housing emergency fund and rapid accommodation
* Free universal healthcare without paperwork barriers
* Immediate safety net activation

=== Phase 2: Enrichment (Months 6-18) ===
* Curiosity-based education systems
* Creative workshops in every community
* Internet as a public utility
* Technology serving humans rather than corporations

=== Phase 3: Community Organization (Months 18-36) ===
* Elimination of professional political classes
* Direct democracy tools for community decision-making
* Natural social organization in communities of 50-150 people
* Consensus-based conflict resolution

=== Phase 4: New Economy (Years 3-5) ===
* Contribution-based society replacing employment
* Resource abundance management
* Circular economy implementation
* Post-scarcity mindset development

=== Phase 5: Cultural Evolution (Years 5+) ===
* Wisdom-based cultural systems
* Planetary stewardship approach
* Intergenerational learning structures
* Long-term thinking for seven generations

== The Pet Humans Test ==

The blueprint includes a policy evaluation framework called "The Pet Humans Test" with four questions:

# "Would I do this to my beloved pet?" - If no, don't do it to humans
# "Does this create fear or joy?" - Choose joy-based policies
# "Does this honor their nature or force compliance?" - Honor natural human needs
# "Would this help them thrive or just survive?" - Aim for thriving, not mere survival

== Critical Mindset Shifts ==

The blueprint identifies four essential mindset changes:

* '''Scarcity to Abundance''': Resources exist; distribution is the challenge
* '''Competition to Cooperation''': Collaboration is more efficient than competition
* '''Control to Care''': Happy humans self-regulate naturally
* '''Production to Fulfillment''': Fulfilled humans create more value than stressed humans

== Economic Foundation ==

The blueprint is supported by the [[19 Trillion Dollar Solution]], which demonstrates that sufficient resources exist to implement pet-human-level care for all citizens through wealth redistribution mechanisms.

== Criticism and Response ==

Critics argue that the comparison between pets and humans oversimplifies complex social and economic relationships. Supporters respond that the simplicity reveals how unnecessarily complex current systems have become, and that basic needs satisfaction is indeed straightforward if resources are properly allocated.
