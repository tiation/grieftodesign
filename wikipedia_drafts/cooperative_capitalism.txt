'''Cooperative Capitalism''' is an economic system that preserves market mechanisms while restructuring ownership, governance, and incentive systems to prioritize cooperation, sustainability, and shared prosperity. It represents a "third way" between traditional competitive capitalism and state-controlled economies.

== Core Principles ==

Cooperative Capitalism is built on five foundational principles:

=== Distributed Ownership ===
Broad-based participation in capital ownership through various mechanisms including:
* [[Employee stock ownership plan|Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)]]
* [[Worker cooperative|Worker cooperatives]]
* Community ownership models
* [[Steward ownership]] structures

=== Stakeholder Governance ===
Decision-making processes that include all affected parties:
* Workers in operational decisions
* Communities in environmental impacts
* Customers in service design
* Future generations in long-term planning

=== Market Design ===
Intentionally structured markets that:
* Internalize environmental and social externalities
* Reward long-term value creation
* Prevent excessive concentration of power
* Enable transparent price discovery

=== Public-Commons-Private Balance ===
Appropriate sector roles based on the nature of goods and services:
* [[Public goods]] managed collectively
* [[Common-pool resource|Common resources]] stewarded by communities
* Private goods allocated through markets
* Mixed ownership for complex services

=== Long-term Value Creation ===
Incentive structures that reward:
* Sustainability over short-term extraction
* Innovation over speculation
* Cooperation over zero-sum competition
* Regeneration over depletion

== Real-World Examples ==
