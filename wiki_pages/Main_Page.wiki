= Welcome to the Grief-to-Design Wiki =

'''From loss to prevention, from tragedy to transformation'''

== Mission ==
This wiki documents the complete Grief-to-Design framework: a systematic approach to preventing future harm by redesigning the systems that create unnecessary suffering.

== Core Belief ==
''People are good. Systems are broken. We can fix the systems.''

== The $19 Trillion Solution ==
Australia has $19 trillion in national wealth. Our proposal:
* '''Universal Asset Allocation''': $200k housing + $200k business credit for every adult
* '''Income Security''': $800/week for 5 years from asset dividends  
* '''Debt Elimination''': Pay off all public debt
* '''System Transformation''': From scarcity to abundance-based governance
