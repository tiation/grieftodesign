#### Key take-aways for defence strategy

* **Pattern recognised** – Australian coroners routinely record drowning/poison tragedies as *accidental* where:

  * lapse is short (seconds–minutes),
  * parent was otherwise diligent,
  * no drugs/alcohol or history of neglect,
  * immediate rescue attempt and 000 call are made.
* **Criminal prosecutions are exceptional** and arise only with gross or prolonged negligence (e.g., leaving child to smoke outside, drug impairment, prior warnings ignored).
* Your factual matrix (line-of-sight supervision, instant CPR, consistent “helicopter” care) is materially **closer to the eight precedents above** than to any manslaughter convictions cited earlier.
