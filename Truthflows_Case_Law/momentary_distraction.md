## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Implications for Your Case

In both cases, the caregivers experienced brief lapses in supervision without prior indications of neglect or intent to harm. The authorities recognized these incidents as tragic accidents rather than criminal acts. Given the similarities to your situation‚Äîspecifically, the brief absence, lack of prior neglect, and immediate response‚Äîit is reasonable to argue that your case aligns with these precedents.
