Certainly, I understand the importance of identifying cases that closely resemble your situation. Upon further research, I have found additional cases where brief lapses in supervision led to tragic outcomes, yet no criminal charges were filed. These cases may provide valuable context and precedent for your circumstances.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Implications for Your Case

These cases further illustrate that brief lapses in supervision, without prior indications of neglect or intent to harm, are often treated as tragic accidents rather than criminal acts by the legal system. In your situation, where you were in close proximity, had no history of neglect, and responded immediately, these precedents support the argument that your case aligns with accidental rather than criminal circumstances.
