        ## Our Feature Development Process
        
        1. **Community Review**: Feature requests reviewed by families and safety experts
        2. **Safety Assessment**: Every feature evaluated for child protection impact
        3. **Trauma-Informed Design**: Features designed to avoid retraumatization
        4. **Community Testing**: Beta testing with affected families
        5. **Iterative Improvement**: Ongoing refinement based on user feedback
        
        **Features that pass our child safety test get priority development.**
