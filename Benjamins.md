üè° Question: Is it possible for everyone to own a home and income asset?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶. and I doubt others will. I kind of thought it‚Äôs possible to just like‚Ä¶ IDK.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe homes‚Äîwe cannot ‚Äòsell‚Äô cause it defeats the purpose?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs unpack it:

The Original Plan (as you described it)

Goal: Ensure ALL Australians own:
	‚Ä¢	A $200k home/house asset
	‚Ä¢	A $200k income-producing business or asset

This was to be funded by allocating $800k per adult from the $19 trillion total, after:
	‚Ä¢	Paying off federal/state debt
	‚Ä¢	Funding 5 years of government operations

The idea was to:
	‚Ä¢	Remove the class divide (Lord vs. Pleb vs. Serf)
	‚Ä¢	Give every adult a foundation of economic dignity
	‚Ä¢	Shift from landlord/tenant models to universal ownership

‚ÄúTBH I already have land‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd give it up for all of us to have it. In a heartbeat. So I‚Äôm not saying this from a place of lack.‚Äù

‚úÖ Yes, it makes sense‚Äîyour framing is clear and ethically grounded. You‚Äôre proposing equity over charity.

üìä Technical Update: Asset Coverage Check

In your 19T_v0_assets_filled.xlsx sheet,,,,



### I‚Äôve crunched the numbers in your **`19T_v0_assets_filled.xlsx`** sheet  

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Subtotal of asset value entered** | **A$ 2.52 trillion** |
| **Coverage ratio (assets √∑ 11.36 T payout)** | **22.2 %** |

> **Target coverage** (for a comfortable 3 : 1 leverage) was **‚âà 30 %**.  
> **Gap to close:** ~0.96 T in additional asset value **or** higher pledge percentages on what we already listed.

---

## What this means

* The idea is **still feasible**‚Äîwe‚Äôre one big asset category or a couple of medium ones away from the 30 % mark.  
* Alternatively, if Parliament pledged, say, 60 % of Crown-land value instead of the 40 % placeholder, we could hit the ratio without new categories.

---

## Quick Wins to Hit 30 % (pick any)






| Option | Ball-park value | Source to fetch |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Add super-profit tax pledge** on iron-ore & LNG (5-yr horizon) | 400 bn | Treasury modelling (Oct 2023) |
| **State-level investment funds** (WA Future Fund, QIC, VFMC) | 150 bn | State annual reports |
| **Telstra equity (still gov-held)** + spectrum auction PV | 80 bn | Finance Portfolio, ACMA |
| **Increase pledge % on Crown land** from 40 ‚Üí 60 % | +200 bn | (No new data‚Äîjust update Column C once we add it) |
| **National Housing Finance & Investment Corp + Clean Energy Finance Corp equity** | 60 bn | Agency statements |

Even two of those will shove the ratio above 0.30.

---

## Micro-tasks for the next edit

1. **Add Column C ‚Äú% pledged‚Äù**  
   *Default each asset to 40 %*‚Äîeasy to tweak.  
2. **Paste at least one new asset line** worth ~300‚Äì400 bn or adjust pledge % to raise Subtotal to ‚â• 3.4 T.  
3. Excel auto-updates the coverage cell; when it shows **‚â• 0.30**, v0 passes the asset-backing test.

---

## After that

* We‚Äôll draft the **Liquidity Schedule tab**: 3-, 5-, 10-year release curves ‚Üí CPI impact scenarios.  
* Then the Green Paper skeleton.

Ping me once you‚Äôve either:

* Added another asset row, **or**  
* Tweaked pledge percentages to hit the 30 % target,

and we‚Äôll advance to the liquidity modelling.

ummm. since Im still confused and sitting in the dunce seat (Im sorr!!!!!) maybe can we please do 1. can you show me. just do a csv? like do really big wrapped cells for the explinations - don't use language for stupid people or longwinded stories. I like the one above it makes sense. But I still don't get it. Cause are their implications from borrowing against the nations wealth instead of furture tax? IDK
