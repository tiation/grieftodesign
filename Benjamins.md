I don't understand.... and I doubt others will. I kind of thought it's possible to just like . Idk. The homes, we cannot 'sell' cause it defeats the purpose. In the original plan. We wanted to ensure ALL Australians OWN: 

1. Income producing asset (so in the original plan we just got the $19T figure, split the entire amount by $population and everyone got $800k after the state/federal government got paid for 5 years including debt paid off. Then we used half of all adults money to buy each adult a $200k 'home' or house asset. And a $200k 'business' or income producing asset. The reasoning behind that? We wanted EVERY person to be a 'Lord' instead of a 'pleb' or 'surf'. Lord, Pleb, Surf are reference to the intergenerational wealth we've had since dollars came in I guess. IDK Im bad at history. But you know like medieval times when only some people could own land and then the rest paid to live on the land etc etc. So sort of exactly what we have now... And TBH I am a person who HAS LAND like I'm already a Lord. But I would totally give it up for all of us to have it. In a heart beat. So I'm not coming to the discussion as a person not benefiting from the current system. Which I guess to me at least: means I am even more accountable for change.)

IDK if that makes sence....

### I’ve crunched the numbers in your **`19T_v0_assets_filled.xlsx`** sheet  

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Subtotal of asset value entered** | **A$ 2.52 trillion** |
| **Coverage ratio (assets ÷ 11.36 T payout)** | **22.2 %** |

> **Target coverage** (for a comfortable 3 : 1 leverage) was **≈ 30 %**.  
> **Gap to close:** ~0.96 T in additional asset value **or** higher pledge percentages on what we already listed.

---

## What this means

* The idea is **still feasible**—we’re one big asset category or a couple of medium ones away from the 30 % mark.  
* Alternatively, if Parliament pledged, say, 60 % of Crown-land value instead of the 40 % placeholder, we could hit the ratio without new categories.

## Quick Wins to Hit 30 % (pick any)






| Option | Ball-park value | Source to fetch |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Add super-profit tax pledge** on iron-ore & LNG (5-yr horizon) | 400 bn | Treasury modelling (Oct 2023) |
| **State-level investment funds** (WA Future Fund, QIC, VFMC) | 150 bn | State annual reports |
| **Telstra equity (still gov-held)** + spectrum auction PV | 80 bn | Finance Portfolio, ACMA |
| **Increase pledge % on Crown land** from 40 → 60 % | +200 bn | (No new data—just update Column C once we add it) |
| **National Housing Finance & Investment Corp + Clean Energy Finance Corp equity** | 60 bn | Agency statements |

Even two of those will shove the ratio above 0.30.

---

## Micro-tasks for the next edit

1. **Add Column C “% pledged”**  
   *Default each asset to 40 %*—easy to tweak.  
2. **Paste at least one new asset line** worth ~300–400 bn or adjust pledge % to raise Subtotal to ≥ 3.4 T.  
3. Excel auto-updates the coverage cell; when it shows **≥ 0.30**, v0 passes the asset-backing test.

---

## After that

* We’ll draft the **Liquidity Schedule tab**: 3-, 5-, 10-year release curves → CPI impact scenarios.  
* Then the Green Paper skeleton.

Ping me once you’ve either:

* Added another asset row, **or**  
* Tweaked pledge percentages to hit the 30 % target,

and we’ll advance to the liquidity modelling.

ummm. since Im still confused and sitting in the dunce seat (Im sorr!!!!!) maybe can we please do 1. can you show me. just do a csv? like do really big wrapped cells for the explinations - don't use language for stupid people or longwinded stories. I like the one above it makes sense. But I still don't get it. Cause are their implications from borrowing against the nations wealth instead of furture tax? IDK
