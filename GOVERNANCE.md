# Governance & Leadership

*"Those most affected by tragedy should lead the transformation. Parents who have lost children understand what needs to change."*

## üèõÔ∏è Our Governance Philosophy

Born from personal loss, Grief-to-Design operates on the principle that **those most affected by the problem should lead the solution**. Our governance structure centers the voices of parents who have lost children, families who have experienced trauma, and communities committed to child protection.

### Core Values
- **Lived Experience Leadership**: Those who understand loss guide our direction
- **Trauma-Informed Decision Making**: All processes recognize the impact of grief and trauma
- **Child-Centered Priorities**: Every decision asks "how does this protect children?"
- **Community Accountability**: Transparency and responsibility to those we serve
- **Healing-Centered Approach**: Governance that promotes healing, not retraumatization
