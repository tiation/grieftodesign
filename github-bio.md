# JT Bone | Systems Designer & Economic Abundance Advocate

## Turning Grief into Transformative Design

After losing my daughter to what society calls a "tragic accident," I discovered that accidents aren't random—they're predictable culminations of tiny, preventable oversights. This revelation led me to develop the **$19 Trillion Solution**: a comprehensive framework for eliminating artificial scarcity and the preventable harms it creates.

## What I'm Building

I design systems that convert national wealth into citizen well-being through practical mechanisms:

- 🏦 **Sovereign Wealth Conversion Fund** — Unlocking $19T in national assets
- 💸 **Digital Civic Shares** — Non-speculative, citizen-owned equity streams
- 🔄 **Weekly Dividend System** — Automatic economic dignity for all
- 🏗️ **Educational Transformation** — From job preparation to lifelong curiosity
- 🛡️ **Safety by Design** — Building prevention into every system

## Current Focus

- 📊 Implementing financial mechanisms that distribute national wealth equitably
- 🔍 Designing and deploying mirror-neuron based educational reforms
- 🔗 Building community safety models that prevent harm through abundance

## My Background

Criminologist, systems designer, and parent who believes that **efficiency** and **compassion** are the same thing. My work proves that we can simultaneously eliminate crime, poverty, and preventable accidents through intelligent resource redistribution.
