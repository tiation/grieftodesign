Quick Reference - Asset Values for Step 2 (Copy-Paste into Column B):

Future Fund portfolio: 250
Commonwealth-owned businesses: 60
Federal & state land banks: 500
Mineral & energy royalties (30yr PV): 1000
State power & rail networks: 400
RBA gold + FX reserves: 130
Public super & Future Fund adjuncts: 50

Total expected: ~2,390 billion = 2.39 trillion

Coverage ratio calculation:
2,390 รท 11,360 = 0.21 (21%)

This means with current rough estimates, we'd need:
- Either 5x leverage (21% ร 5 = 105%)
- Or find more assets worth ~9 trillion
- Or a combination (e.g., 3x leverage + more assets)

Next steps after you paste these:
1. Add the SUM formula in the Subtotal row
2. Add the coverage ratio formula: =Subtotal_cell/11360
3. See what percentage you get
4. Tomorrow we'll refine with real citations and add leverage scenarios

Remember: This is just V0 to see the shape of the challenge!
