## 🎤 **INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS**

### Key Message Framework 1: For Parent/Community Interviews

#### Opening Hook (15 seconds)
"Every parent's worst nightmare is losing a child to something that could have been prevented. But what if I told you that some Australian communities have already figured out how to prevent these tragedies entirely?"

#### Core Messages
1. **Prevention is Proven**: "We're not talking about theory—[X] Australian communities have already achieved zero preventable deaths through community-led prevention."

2. **Community Ownership**: "This isn't about government programs or professional services. This is about neighbors helping neighbors learn the skills that save lives."

3. **Simple but Effective**: "We're talking about practical things—CPR training at community BBQs, neighbors checking on each other, sharing resources when families are struggling."

4. **Immediate Results**: "Within [timeframe], communities see measurable results—fewer incidents, stronger connections, families feeling safer."

#### Response to Common Questions

**Q: "Isn't this just common sense?"**
A: "Exactly—it is common sense. But common sense only works when it's commonly practiced. These communities have organized their common sense into systems that actually work."

**Q: "What about personal responsibility?"**
A: "This is personal responsibility multiplied by community support. When everyone knows CPR, everyone shares responsibility for water safety. When neighbors know each other, everyone shares responsibility for community safety."

**Q: "How do we know this actually works?"**
A: "Look at [specific community] - they went from [X incidents per year] to zero after implementing prevention. Look at [another community] - [specific metric improvement]. The evidence is communities that are already living it."

#### Closing Call to Action
"The question isn't whether prevention works—we know it does. The question is: how many more families have to experience preventable tragedy before we decide to start good in our own communities?"

### Key Message Framework 2: For Political/Policy Interviews

#### Opening Hook
"Prevention costs dollars. Crisis costs lives. Right now, we're spending millions responding to tragedies that proven community programs could prevent for thousands."

#### Core Messages
1. **Fiscal Responsibility**: "Prevention programs cost $10,000 per community. Crisis response costs $100,000 per incident. We're talking about a 10:1 cost advantage."

2. **Evidence-Based Policy**: "[X] Australian communities have already proven this works with [specific results]. We're not asking for experimental funding—we're asking to scale what's already successful."

3. **Bipartisan Appeal**: "Prevention isn't left or right—it's forward. Labor communities and Liberal communities are both achieving the same excellent results."

4. **Government Role**: "We're not asking government to run these programs. We're asking government to support communities that want to run them themselves."

#### Response to Political Questions

**Q: "How do we know this isn't just feel-good spending?"**
A: "Because we're measuring results, not just inputs. Communities with prevention programs show [specific metrics]. Communities without them continue experiencing [specific problems]."

**Q: "What about existing services and departments?"**
A: "Prevention makes their jobs easier, not harder. Police prefer preventing crime to investigating it. Ambulance officers prefer preventing accidents to responding to them. This supports professional services by reducing demand."

**Q: "Can this really scale to whole states/nation?"**
A: "We're not scaling programs—we're scaling permission and support. Each community designs its own prevention approach based on local needs. Government provides training, resources, and coordination."

#### Policy Specific Points
- **Budget Impact**: "Every dollar invested in prevention saves $3 in crisis response costs within 2 years."
- **Electoral Appeal**: "Constituents want their communities to be safe and connected. Prevention delivers both."
- **Implementation**: "Pilot programs can begin in [timeframe] with results measurable within [timeframe]."

Subject: How [Nearby Community] Went from 3 Drownings to Zero

Hi [Name],

I don't know if you heard, but [Nearby Community] hasn't had a single preventable death since they started their prevention program in [Year].

Before that? They were losing 2-3 kids every summer.

The difference? They decided to train everyone in CPR and water safety instead of just hoping tragedies wouldn't happen.

Now 80% of adults know CPR. Every pool gets safety-checked monthly. And most importantly—every child is watched by everyone.

[Your Community] faces the same risks [Nearby Community] used to face. 

But we could achieve the same results.

I'm organizing a community meeting to explore starting our own prevention program. Interested in learning more?

Meeting: [Date/Time/Location]
What to expect: 
- Hear from [Nearby Community] about their success
- Learn what prevention could look like for us
- Meet neighbors who want to start good

Reply if you're interested or just show up. 

We start good now—not after the next tragedy.

[Your name]
[Your contact]

P.S. - Feel free to forward this to neighbors who might be interested. The more people who care, the stronger our prevention becomes.
```

### Email 2: Government/Political Outreach
```
Subject: $[X] Investment Could Prevent Next [Local Tragedy Type]

Dear [MP/Minister Name],

[Recent local incident] could have been prevented.

I'm writing as a [constituent/community leader] to bring your attention to proven community prevention programs that could prevent similar tragedies in [electorate/region].

The Evidence:
- [Community A]: 0 drownings since prevention program (previously 2-3 annually)
- [Community B]: 60% reduction in domestic violence calls
- [Community C]: $3 saved in crisis response for every $1 invested in prevention

[X] Australian communities have already proven this works.

The Investment:
- $[amount] per community for training and resources
- Self-sustaining after initial setup
- Measurable results within 6-12 months
- Strong electoral appeal across all demographics

The Opportunity:
Your leadership on prevention-first policy could:
1. Save lives in [electorate/region]
2. Demonstrate fiscal responsibility 
3. Position [party] as innovative and community-focused
4. Create replicable model for other regions

I'd welcome the opportunity to brief you on specific prevention programs and their results.
