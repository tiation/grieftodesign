# Pilot Program Design Manual: Grief-to-Design Community Implementation

## Executive Summary

This manual provides step-by-step protocols for implementing and measuring grief-to-design principles in real communities. It transforms theoretical frameworks into testable, measurable interventions that can demonstrate the effectiveness of prevention-first approaches.

## 🎯 **Pilot Program Overview**

### Purpose
Demonstrate that **"starting good"** approaches prevent harm more effectively than **"stopping bad"** approaches, while measuring the impact on community wellbeing, safety, and connection.

### Duration
**12-month pilot** with 6-month baseline + 6-month intervention

### Scale
**Neighborhood level** (500-2,000 residents) for manageable measurement and meaningful impact

## 📍 **Community Selection Criteria**

### Primary Requirements
- **Population**: 500-2,000 residents
- **Measurable boundaries** (suburb, housing estate, school catchment)
- **Baseline challenges** (one or more: crime, child safety concerns, social isolation, economic stress)
- **Community leadership** willing to participate
- **Local government support** for data access

### Ideal Characteristics
- **Mixed demographic** (diverse ages, backgrounds, income levels)
- **Existing infrastructure** (community center, school, local businesses)
- **Recent concerning incident** that could have been prevented (motivates participation)
- **Absence of major ongoing interventions** (clean measurement)

### Red Flags (Avoid)
- Active major construction/development
- Existing large-scale social programs
- Extreme transience (>50% resident turnover annually)
- Active community conflict or division
