## The $19 Trillion Solution 💡

Australia sits on $19 trillion in national wealth. We can:
- ✅ **Erase all debt** ($786B) immediately
- ✅ **Pre-pay government** for 5 years ($5.29T)  
- ✅ **Give every adult**: $104k housing + $104k business + $800/week
- ✅ **Give every child**: $52k housing + $52k investments + $400/week + $208k future fund

**Result**: Scarcity-driven crime, violence, and desperation disappear overnight.

## Why "Chase White Rabbit"? 🕳️
Like Alice, we dive after the impossible idea—*and we bring back the blueprint so everyone can follow.*

From personal tragedy (losing my daughter in a preventable accident) to universal prevention: if we can eliminate scarcity, we can eliminate the thousand tiny stresses that compound into catastrophe.
