# Funding & Sustainability

*"Money should serve love, not the other way around. Every dollar must pass the test: would I spend this to save my own child?"*

## üíô Our Funding Philosophy

This project was born from the ultimate loss‚Äîa child's life. Every funding decision honors that loss by ensuring resources serve their highest purpose: protecting children and supporting grieving families.

### Core Principles
- **Children First**: All funding decisions prioritize child safety outcomes
- **Radical Transparency**: Every dollar tracked and publicly reported
- **Community Ownership**: Families affected by loss guide funding priorities
- **Sustainable Impact**: Build systems that protect children long-term
- **No Exploitation**: Never profit from others' pain or vulnerability

## üíô The Bottom Line

**Every dollar donated is a commitment to ensuring no other parent experiences our loss.**

Funding this work isn't charity‚Äîit's investment in a world where children are truly safe, families are genuinely supported, and communities are trauma-informed and healing-centered.

Your support doesn't just fund programs. It honors the memory of every child we couldn't save by protecting the children we still can.
