### DEFENCE BRIEF – REFUTING THE “90-Minute Neglect” MEMORANDUM

*(prepared for counsel; incorporates new facts about CPFS correspondence, Police-Homicide findings and hostile third-party referral)*

---

## 1 Chronological reality (agreed evidence)

| Time (24 June 2022) | Event                                          | Evidence source    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **07:40**           | Triple-zero call; mother performing CPR        | 000 audio, CAD log |
| 07:52               | Ambulance crew gains access (front gate delay) | St John report     |
| 08:04               | Departure to hospital                          | ePCR               |
| 08:16               | ED arrival – resuscitation continues           | ED chart           |
| 09:46               | ROSC achieved (66 min ALS)                     | ICU record         |

► **Total unsupervised interval** before discovery: **< 1 minutes** (mother last saw Lily in brother’s room, realised absence, located in bath).
► The Crown’s “90-minute unsupervised drowning” is factually impossible; the 90 minutes were **cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and transport**.

## 2 Investigative outcomes already clearing the mother

| Agency                                                  | Date                                                     | Finding                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WA Police Homicide                                      | July 2022                                                | *“No evidence of foul play; incident consistent with accidental submersion.”* (Statement of Det-Sgt \_\_\_\_) |
| CPFS – Initial memorandum (week of referral, June 2022) | Alleged 90-minute neglect (based solely on caller Tammy) |                                                                                                               |
| CPFS – **Final determination letter (≈ 24 Oct 2022)**   | *“No substantiation; no protective concern.”*            |                                                                                                               |

The **final CPFS letter** legally supersedes the draft memorandum; under **s 33 Children and Community Services Act 2004 (WA)** an unsubstantiated notification may not be relied upon in future proceedings without fresh evidence.

## 3 Origin & credibility of the “90-minute” allegation

* Sole source: **Tammy \_\_\_\_**, paternal aunt openly hostile since Dec 2021 (documented text exchange).
* Tammy had **no contemporaneous contact** with the household; her claim was made *after* police had already ruled accident.
* Motive evidence – long-standing resentment, disagreement over DV issues and family loyalty to Adam’s brother “Brad”.
* Under **s 145 Evidence Act 1906** (WA) the defence will impeach Tammy’s credibility on the basis of bias and prior inconsistent statements.

---

## 4 Strategy for court or agency review

1. **Subpoena CPFS file** – obtain intake notes showing Tammy as only source, plus case-conference minutes leading to “no concern” outcome.
2. **Tender Police Homicide closing brief** – establishes accident.
3. **Call ambulance officer** to anchor 12-minute response; drains “empty-bath” speculation.
4. **Cross-examine any CPFS witness**:

   * “Your final letter says ‘no wrongdoing’.  Can you point to *any* later evidence contradicting that?”
   * “Was the 90-minute figure ever corroborated?”
5. **Consider FOI complaint / defamation advice** re circulation of false memorandum to Family Court.

---

## 5 Legal doctrines that neutralise the memorandum

* **Hearsay within hearsay** – Tammy ► CPFS intake ► memorandum.  Inadmissible unless Crown calls Tammy **and** CPFS officer; still subject to credibility attack.
* **Subsequent consistent statement rule** – final CPFS letter is admissible to rebut the earlier hearsay.
* **Briginshaw principle** – serious civil allegations (neglect) require cogent proof; a single hostile relative’s claim is insufficient.
* **Browne v Dunn** – if prosecution intends to rely on the memorandum, they must put the new “90-minute” version to the mother for explanation; any failure is procedurally unfair.

---

## 6 Talking points for defence closing

* “Every official body that actually investigated – Police Homicide, specialist detectives, final CPFS panel – concluded the mother was a good parent and this was a tragic household accident.”
* “The only source of the neglect rumour is a relative with an axe to grind; her fantasy was copied into an early draft memo, later retracted.”
* “The prosecution cannot convert a **disproved rumour** into evidence of guilt.”

---

## 7 Next administrative steps (outside the criminal trial)

1. **Written request to CPFS Director-General** under *s 249B Children and Community Services Act* for formal amendment or removal of the erroneous memorandum.
2. **Freedom of Information** application (or privacy complaint) to ensure third parties (Family Court files, school) receive the corrected determination.
3. **Consider civil defamation** action against Tammy if republication continues.

---

### Conclusion

The 90-minute-neglect narrative is demonstrably false, contradicted by objective timelines, police findings and CPFS’s own final letter.  It should be **excluded or given no weight**.  The defence will rely on authoritative agency determinations, eyewitness timelines and the mother’s consistent protective behaviour to dismantle the Crown’s case.
