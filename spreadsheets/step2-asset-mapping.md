## Implementation Timeline

### Year 1: Foundation
- Establish Sovereign Equity Fund legislation
- Complete asset valuations and transfers
- Set up digital dividend infrastructure
- Begin with 50% of intended leverage (safety buffer)

### Year 2-3: Ramp Up
- Increase leverage to target levels
- Begin full citizen dividend payments
- Monitor inflation and economic stability
- Adjust parameters based on real-world performance

### Year 4-5: Optimization
- Fine-tune asset mix and leverage
- Expand or contract program based on outcomes
- Prepare for potential program evolution

## Risk Mitigation

### Asset Diversification
- **Resource-based**: 40.7% (minerals, energy, land)
- **Financial**: 27.4% (Future Fund, reserves, state funds)  
- **Infrastructure**: 21.9% (transport, utilities, telecommunications)

### Liquidity Management
- **Highly liquid**: 15% (cash, listed investments)
- **Semi-liquid**: 45% (infrastructure bonds, listed REITs)
- **Illiquid**: 40% (land, long-term royalties)

### Economic Safeguards

- Reserve Bank coordination for monetary policy alignment

## Status: ✅ VIABLE WITH CONSERVATIVE LEVERAGE

Even with conservative 3:1 leverage, the asset base supports the full $11.36T program with a 10.7% safety margin.

## Formulas (for Excel/spreadsheet recreation)
```
Pledged_value = Asset_value × Percent_pledged
Total_pledged = SUM(all_pledged_values)
Coverage_ratio = Total_pledged ÷ Required_funding
Leverage_multiple = Required_funding ÷ Total_pledged
Fund_size = Total_pledged × (1 + Leverage_multiple)
Safety_margin = Fund_size - Required_funding
```
