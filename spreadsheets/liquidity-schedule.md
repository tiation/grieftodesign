| **Total** | **$2,800B** | | |

### Years 3-5: Sustainability Phase
| Year | Annual Outflow (AUD Billions) | Primary Funding | Key Milestone |
|------|-------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Year 3 | $2,200B | Asset portfolio returns | 75% allocation complete |
| Year 4 | $1,800B | Economic growth dividends | 90% allocation complete |
| Year 5 | $1,200B | Self-sustaining system | 100% allocation complete |

## Inflation Management Strategy

### Controlled Release Mechanism
- **Quarterly caps**: Maximum $1T release per quarter
- **Regional distribution**: Staggered rollout across states
- **Asset-backed security**: All releases backed by real assets

### Inflation Mitigation Measures
1. **Supply-side investment**: 30% of funds directed to production capacity
2. **Import capacity expansion**: Temporary increase in foreign goods access
3. **Price stability monitoring**: Real-time CPI tracking with adjustment triggers
4. **Regional balancing**: Prevent localized inflation hotspots

## Liquidity Sources Breakdown

### Primary Sources ($11.36T Total Need)
| Source | Amount (AUD Billions) | Availability Timeline | Risk Level |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Real Estate Leverage | $4,200B | Years 1-2 | Low |
| Corporate Asset Leverage | $2,800B | Years 1-3 | Medium |
| Government Bond Issuance | $2,100B | Year 1 | Low |
| Infrastructure Asset Sales | $1,500B | Years 2-3 | Medium |
| Resource Revenue Bonds | $760B | Years 1-5 | Low |

### Liquidity Buffer Management
- **Emergency reserves**: $500B liquid buffer maintained
- **Contingency bonds**: $300B pre-approved emergency funding
- **Asset sale flexibility**: $200B in readily liquidatable assets

## Economic Impact Modeling

### GDP Impact Projections
| Year | GDP Growth Impact | Multiplier Effect | Net Economic Benefit |
|------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Year 1 | +2.3% | 1.4x | $780B additional GDP |
| Year 2 | +4.1% | 1.6x | $1,200B additional GDP |
| Year 3 | +3.8% | 1.8x | $1,450B additional GDP |
| Year 4 | +3.2% | 1.9x | $1,380B additional GDP |
| Year 5 | +2.8% | 2.0x | $1,290B additional GDP |

### Inflation Projections vs Mitigations
| Year | Base Case Inflation | With Mitigations | Target Range |
|------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Year 1 | 4.2% | 2.8% | 2.0-3.5% |
| Year 2 | 5.8% | 3.1% | 2.5-4.0% |
| Year 3 | 3.9% | 2.9% | 2.0-3.5% |
| Year 4 | 3.2% | 2.4% | 2.0-3.0% |
| Year 5 | 2.8% | 2.1% | 2.0-2.5% |

## Risk Management

### Liquidity Risk Mitigation
1. **Diversified funding**: No single source >40% of total
2. **Staggered implementation**: Ability to pause/adjust quarterly
3. **Market monitoring**: Real-time liquidity stress testing
4. **International coordination**: IMF/World Bank partnership agreements

### Stress Test Scenarios
- **Market downturn**: 30% asset value decline - System remains viable
- **Interest rate spike**: +4% rates - Manageable with extended timeline
- **Global recession**: 15% GDP contraction - Reduced but sustainable implementation

## Quarterly Review Process

### Monitoring Metrics
- Liquidity ratios (target: >1.5x coverage)
- Inflation rates (target: <3.5% annually)
- Asset performance (target: >6% returns)
- Implementation pace (target: on-schedule Â±10%)

### Adjustment Triggers
- **Inflation >4%**: Reduce quarterly disbursements by 25%
- **Liquidity <1.2x**: Increase asset sales/leverage
- **Market stress**: Activate contingency funding protocols

## International Precedents

### Successful Large-Scale Implementations
- **Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund**: $1.4T managed successfully
- **Alaska Permanent Fund**: 45-year dividend sustainability
- **Singapore Temasek**: 15% average returns over 50 years

### Lessons Applied
- Transparent governance prevents political interference
- Diversified investments reduce systemic risk
- Gradual implementation allows market adaptation
