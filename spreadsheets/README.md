# $19T Solution - Spreadsheet Analysis

This directory contains the comprehensive mathematical analysis for the $19 Trillion Solution, broken down into manageable components.

## Files Overview

### Core Analysis
- **[19T-solution-summary.md](./19T-solution-summary.md)** - Executive summary and key findings
- **[step1-population-payouts.md](./step1-population-payouts.md)** - Population data and per-person allocation calculations  
- **[step2-asset-mapping.md](./step2-asset-mapping.md)** - National asset inventory and funding sources

### Quick Reference
- **[asset-values-quick-reference.txt](../asset-values-quick-reference.txt)** - Simple copy-paste values for Excel

## Key Findings

✅ **MATHEMATICALLY VIABLE**
- Required funding: $11.36 trillion
- Available collateral: $3.14 trillion (pledged from $8.33T total assets)
- Leverage needed: 3.6:1 (conservative for sovereign funds)
- Safety margin: 10.7% with 3:1 leverage

## How to Use These Files

### For Spreadsheet Recreation
1. Open **step1-population-payouts.md** for basic formulas
2. Use **step2-asset-mapping.md** for asset values and pledge percentages
3. Refer to **19T-solution-summary.md** for verification of calculations

### For Policy Development
1. Start with **19T-solution-summary.md** for overview
2. Use detailed asset mapping for legislative drafting
3. Reference risk assessment for implementation planning

### For Public Communication
1. **Executive Summary** section provides key talking points
2. **Comparison to Existing Programs** shows precedent
3. **Implementation Pathway** outlines realistic timeline

## Excel/Spreadsheet Formulas

### Step 1: Population Calculations
```
Adult_total = Adults_count × Adult_payout
Youth_total = Youth_count × Youth_payout  
Grand_total = Adult_total + Youth_total
```

### Step 2: Asset Analysis
```
Pledged_value = Asset_value × Percent_pledged
Total_pledged = SUM(all_pledged_values)
Coverage_ratio = Total_pledged ÷ Required_funding
Leverage_multiple = Required_funding ÷ Total_pledged
```

## Status

**Current Version: 0.1**
- Population estimates: ABS 2025 projections
- Asset values: Conservative estimates with cited sources
- Leverage assumptions: 3:1 conservative, 4:1 moderate, 5:1 aggressive

**Next Steps:**
1. Refine asset valuations with specific ABS citations
2. Add inflation modeling scenarios
3. Develop detailed implementation timeline
4. Create political engagement strategy
