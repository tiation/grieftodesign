*A Personal Note from the Convenor of the $19 Trillion Solution*

## Why This Initiative Exists
Australia is wealthy on paper yet anxious in spirit.  Household debt is climbing, essential services are stretched, and an entire generation is locked out of secure housing.  At dinner-tables, in board-rooms and on building sites the same question echoes: *“Surely there must be a better way?”*  

The $19 Trillion Solution began as a working sketch on my kitchen table – a “what-if” exercise that asked whether the assets we **already** own together could be mobilised to rewrite our collective balance-sheet.  That sketch has since grown into a citizen-owned blueprint to unlock **one-third of the nation’s $19 T balance-sheet**, eliminate public debt, pre-pay five years of services, and issue every resident a tangible stake in our shared future.

## My Story & the Spark
I was raised in a fibro house on the edges of a regional city.  Mum juggled two jobs, Dad drove trucks at night, and my first lessons in “economics” involved calculating which bills we could delay without the lights being cut.  Scholarships put me through university where I studied systems engineering by day and volunteered at a homelessness shelter by night.

A decade of designing infrastructure projects taught me how value is *created*, *trapped* and too often *leaked* away from the very communities that fund it.  When the pandemic hit and friends lost both income and certainty, I returned to the kitchen table with stacks of balance-sheet print-outs, determined to prove that abundance was not the privilege of the few but the birth-right of the many.

## From Kitchen Table to Collective Blueprint
What started as coloured Post-it notes quickly became a multidisciplinary collaboration across activists, economists, software engineers, First-Nations leaders and parents racing a rising rent notice.  The more diverse the circle, the clearer the pattern: **Australia is asset-rich but cash-poor**.  By securitising under-utilised public assets inside a citizen trust, we could refinance the Commonwealth in one audacious move—without selling a single family home or raising new taxes.

## The Larger Vision
1. **Debt-Free Governance** – Retire federal, state and local debt so every future budget begins at zero.
2. **Universal Asset Dividend** – Provide each resident with:
   • **$104 k Housing Credit**  
   • **$104 k Business / Portfolio Units**  
   • **$208 k cash flow** (≈ $800 p/w for 5 years)
3. **Five-Year Service Pre-Payment** – Fully fund health, education and aged-care upfront, freeing policy-makers to innovate instead of constantly patching gaps.
4. **Citizen Steering Circle** – Embed everyday Australians in the governance stack so that transparency is baked in from day one.

The audacity is deliberate.  Incrementalism cannot heal structural inequality; only a whole-of-balance-sheet reset can.

## How My Story Fits the Mission
• **Systems Lens** – Engineering taught me to look at feedback loops, not isolated events.  The initiative is designed as a closed-loop economy where value circulates locally.

• **Lived Experience** – Knowing housing insecurity firsthand keeps the blueprint tethered to real kitchen-table stakes, not abstract KPIs.

• **Bridge-Building** – Years spent translating between engineers, financiers and community organisers shaped the collaborative architecture of this project.

## An Invitation
This document you are holding – and the wider wiki it lives inside – is not a manifesto to be *read* but a workshop to be *used*.  You will find engineering diagrams beside human-centred design sprints, fiscal models adjacent to children’s storyboards.  Add to it.  Challenge it.  Stress-test every assumption until it either breaks or becomes unshakeable truth.

If my personal journey offers any lesson, it is that proximity to a problem is a super-power, not a handicap.  Your own story—whether forged in parliament, a factory, or raising kids on a shoestring—belongs at this table.  Together we can convert private frustrations into one collective, measurable, and historic solution.

Welcome aboard.
