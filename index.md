## The Vision

Imagine a world where everyone is a "little lord," where wealth isn't just for the few.

Australia's balance sheet shows we're a $19 trillion nation. By unlocking a portion of this wealth, we can pay off debts, empower every citizen with assets, and create an abundance that has been mere dreams.

### The Problem: Artificial Scarcity

Crime, poverty, and system burnout thrive on the misconception of **unnatural scarcity**.

**Revelation:** We are sitting on $19 trillion of net wealth but act as though we're broke.

**The Flip:** Convert that wealth on paper into real spending power for every Australian.

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **No houses sold** - We leverage existing national assets (mines, infrastructure, public equity)
2. **Sovereign Equity Fund** issues digital shares to every citizen
3. **Asset-backed payments** prevent inflation (like stimulus but backed by real assets)
4. **Metered weekly payments** maintain economic stability
5. **Everyone gets both security AND opportunity**

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't $19T tied up in assets we can't sell?**
A: Exactly! We don't sell houses. We leverage a portion of collective assets (mines, infrastructure, public equity) to create a fund that pays dividends to citizens.

**Q: What about inflation?**
A: Payments are asset-backed and metered weekly. We manage liquidity like we did with pandemic stimulus, but backed by real assets instead of debt.

**Q: Will this kill work ethic?**
A: Research shows UBI doesn't stop people working. With basic needs met, entrepreneurship and meaningful work actually increase. People leave bad jobs, not all jobs.

**Q: This sounds impossible.**
A: The math works. The assets exist. The challenge is political will and coordinating the largest legislative effort in Australian history.

## Remember Why

This isn't just about numbers. It's about ensuring every person has the opportunity to flourish. It's about creating a society where we're all "lords" with real assets and security, instead of the current system where most people are essentially "serfs" paying rent to those who already own everything.

It's about making sure that no child dies from poverty, violence, or systemic neglect. It's about honoring those we've lost by building the world they deserved to grow up in.
