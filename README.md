## Purpose

This document is a public, perpetual record. It captures the why, the what, and the how of a complete systemic redesign — built from personal loss, designed to prevent future harm. Anyone is free to read, share, adapt, and continue this work. If the original author is gone, let this be a living foundation.

## Origin

This work was created by someone who lost their child. Not to ideology. To bad luck. Was it preventable? You bet. I did a causal analysis like Cockburn Cement (marginal industry) does causal analysis. There are obvious preventions. And yet, I see longer lines of causality containing remnants of systemic failure. In my case, and in the case of many other parents I worked with prior. And many other parents who shared their story, meant to comfort, after. 

I have nothing. Anymore. And I will not die without changing the things I think had even a fraction of causality in the loss my baby had. I will not do anything negative in her name no matter how much my feeling at times encourages it. I live forever for you. My daughter. My son. We lost everything we ever had together. In seconds. Gone. That day.

This blueprint is my promise turned into process.

## Core Belief

> People are good. Systems are broken. We can fix the systems.

we start again... not from zero but from loss
