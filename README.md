## Purpose

This document is a public, perpetual record. It captures the why, the what, and the how of a complete systemic redesign — built from personal loss, designed to prevent future harm. Anyone is free to read, share, adapt, and continue this work. If the original author is gone, let this be a living foundation.

## Origin

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d20502-c1a1-4333-84cd-bc5f479de9d4)


This work was created by someone who lost their child. Not to ideology. To bad luck. Was it preventable? You bet. I did a causal analysis like Cockburn Cement (marginal industry) does causal analysis. There are obvious preventions. And yet, I see longer lines of causality containing remnants of systemic failure. In my case, and in the case of many other parents I worked with prior. And many other parents who shared their story, meant to comfort, after. 

I have nothing. Anymore. And I will not die without changing the things I think had even a fraction of causality in the loss my baby had. I will not do anything negative in her name no matter how much my feeling at times encourages it. I live forever for you. My daughter. My son. We lost everything we ever had together. In seconds. Gone. That day.

This blueprint is my promise turned into process.

## Core Belief

> People are good. Systems are broken. We can fix the systems.

## Grief-to-Design: The Template (For Anyone to Use)

1. **What did I lose?**
   *A  life. A child. A friend. A future. Something that mattered.*

2. **What caused it?**
   *Not just the surface event — but every system that created it.*

3. **What would have prevented it?**
   *More time. People's capacity. Safety built in. Accountability upstream.*

4. **What system could stop it from happening again?**
   *A just, open, kind, and autonomous one. Built on abundance, not fear.*

5. **What’s the first step I can take today?**
   *Write. Share. Act. Even one page like this makes it real.*

## The 12 Acts of Systemic Redesign (From the Original Blueprint)

1. **Sovereign Equity Fund Act**
   Public wealth redistributed to erase scarcity, pay all debt, and fund essential services.

2. **Universal Dividend Act**
   Every person receives \$800/week for 5 years. No bureaucracy, no permission.

3. **No Politicians Act**
   Replace political class with citizen panels, expert drafters, and open-source AI oversight.

4. **Voting-as-a-Right Act**
   Simple digital or kiosk voting on budgets and major laws. Like Facebook, but real.

5. **Two-Monkey Mutual-Benefit Act**
   Any policy that harms more than it helps cannot proceed. Fairness is law.

6. **Five-Star Justice Act**
   Crime is treated as trauma. Offenders go to recovery retreats, not cages.

7. **No-Strike Child Guidance Act**
   No violence toward children. Ever. Evidence-based positive guidance replaces punishment.

8. **Trust Default Act**
   Design assumes cooperation, not corruption. Light replaces locks.

9. **All-or-None Surveillance Act**
   If surveillance exists, it is public. No private feeds. No privileged eyes.

10. **Relational Health for Life Act**
    Regular emotional check-ins, mentor access, attachment care for all ages.

11. **Education as Curiosity Act**
    School is replaced with Montessori-style curiosity labs and adult modeling.

12. **Autonomy-with-a-Floor Act**
    You can do whatever you like — but no one wins at another’s expense.

## Three Brands, One Mission

### 💰 **$19T** - "I'm selfish  so are you."
*Converting Australia's $19 trillion national wealth into real opportunities for every citizen*

### 🐰 **Chase White Rabbit** - "People aren't broken. Fix the system."
*Following curiosity to find systemic solutions through research and analysis*

### 🌍 **Tiation** - "Get bored of it."
*Solving problems until they're routine, then moving to the next challenge*

## The $19 Trillion Solution

**[Full Homepage: index.md](./index.md)**

Australia sits on $19 trillion in net national wealth. Our solution:
- **Universal Asset Allocation**: $200k housing + $200k business credit for every adult
- **Income Security**: $800/week for 5 years from asset dividends
- **Debt Elimination**: Pay off all public debt
- **System Transformation**: From scarcity to abundance-based governance
