# From Grief to Design: The $19 Trillion Solution

## About Me
After losing my daughter to what society calls a "tragic accident," I discovered that accidents aren't random—they're predictable culminations of preventable oversights. This revelation led me to develop the **$19 Trillion Solution**: a framework for eliminating artificial scarcity and creating universal safety through design.

> "Fix the system. People aren't broken."

## What I'm Building

I design systems that convert national wealth into citizen well-being:

- 🏦 **Sovereign Wealth Conversion Fund** — Unlocking $19T in national assets
- 💸 **Digital Civic Shares** — Non-speculative equity streams for all citizens
- 🔄 **Weekly Dividend System** — $800/week for adults, $400/week for youth
- 🏘️ **Universal Housing Equity** — $104,000 per adult in housing security
- 🧠 **Mirror Neuron Education** — Teaching through demonstration, not instruction
- 🛡️ **Safety by Design** — Prevention built into every system

## My Background

Criminologist, systems designer, and parent who believes that **efficiency** and **compassion** are the same thing. My work proves that we can eliminate crime, poverty, and preventable accidents through intelligent resource redistribution.

*From deep personal loss to systemic redesign: I'm creating a world where no parent gets the midnight call I did—not through luck, but through design.*
